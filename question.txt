Python Programming

PROJECT 5 PROPOSAL

Idea: Chat Application

Description:

For Beginners: Create a basic text-based chat application in Python where two users can exchange messages in real-time using the command line. Implement a simple client-server model for message exchange.

For Advanced: Develop an advanced chat application with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter, PyQt, or a web framework. Add features like user authentication, multiple chat rooms, multimedia sharing (images, videos), message history, notifications, emojis, and encryption for data security.

Key Concepts and Challenges:

1. Networking (for Beginners): Learn socket programming for real-time communication between clients and a server.

2. User Interface (for Advanced): Design an intuitive, responsive interface for the chat application.

3. Authentication (for Advanced): Implement user registration and login to secure the chat. 4. Multimedia Sharing (for Advanced): Enable users to send and receive multimedia content. 5. Message History (for Advanced): Store and display message history for reference.

6. Notifications (for Advanced): Provide notifications for new messages, even when the chat window is minimized.

7. Emoji Support (for Advanced): Implement emoji support within messages.

8. Security (for Advanced): Ensure data security through encryption and other security 3

measures.
